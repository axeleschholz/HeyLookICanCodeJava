# HeyLookICanCodeJava
These are some assignments from one of the core coding concepts courses I took in school. Conceptually it's pretty basic, starting off with the basics of Object-Oriented-Programming and then eventually getting into some slightly more complex stuff like polymorphism and interfaces. The point of this repository is more to just have a record of my competency in Java.
